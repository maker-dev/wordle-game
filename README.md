# Wordle Game - Backend (PHP) & Frontend (React)

A Wordle game built with a PHP backend and a React frontend. The game features word validation through an API, input validation alerts, animations, and a secure session-based mechanism to hide the solution from the user.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Word Validation**: Words are validated using an external API to check if they exist and meet the correct length.
- **Input Alerts**: Alerts notify the user of invalid inputs such as incorrect word length or non-dictionary words.
- **Win/Loss Feedback**: A modal displays a message when the user wins or loses the game.
- **Session-Based Security**: The solution is stored securely in the user's session to prevent them from knowing the correct answer.
- **Animations**: Smooth animations for user interactions, including word guessing and feedback.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Backend framework for handling game logic and API integration.
- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface and managing state.
- **Session Management**: To store the solution securely on the backend.
